(defgeneric open-application-handler (application appleevent reply refcon)

The generic function open-application-handler handles the Open
Application Apple event. The default method does nothing.

APPLICATION:    The application.  MCL standard event handling always
                uses the value of *APPLICATION*.

APPLEEVENT:     The Apple event, which is an MCL object of type macptr
                and a record of type AEDesc—a record with only two
                fields, a type and a handle.  MCL users generally do
                not have to look at the record structure directly. 

REPLY:          Another Apple event record, provided by the Apple
                Event Manager.  If a reply is required, information
                should be copied into this record using Apple Event
                Manager calls. 

REFCON:         The handler reference constant, which is any Lisp
                object.  When the handler is installed, you have the
                option of specifying some Lisp object that serves to
                distinguish (for instance) two different installations
                of the same handler.  The reference constant is often
                ignored.

The WITH-AEDESCS macro creates a temporary record of type AEDesc for

WITH-AEDESCS disposes of all its temporary records in the correct way.
If the data handle has anything in it, WITH-AEDESCS calls
#_|AEDisposeDesc|. 

Thus any memory allocated by the Apple Event Manager is properly
disposed of. 

If you have a need for an AEDesc record with indefinite extent, you must
use MAKE-RECORD.  When you want to dispose of the record, you must
explicitly call #_|AEDisposeDesc|, then dispose-record.
