system assumes the event has been handled and no further processing is
done.  If the function returns NIL, the event system assumes the event
hasn’t been handled and the normal event handlers are invoked.

The *IDLE* variable signals the event system that the main Lisp
process is idle. This changes the sleep time that event dispatch gives

The *CURSORHOOK* variable may be bound to a function or cursor, giving
you complete control over the appearance of the cursor.  This variable
is bound by WITH-CURSOR.

If the value of this variable is non-nil, then no other cursor
functions are called.  If the value of *CURSORHOOK* IS a function, it
is called repeatedly in the background and has complete control over
the state of the cursor at all times.

If it is not a function, it should be a cursor record or a 'CURS'
resource ID.

Its initial value is an internal function that allows events to alter
the cursor normally.

The *SCRAP-HANDLER-ALIST* variable contains an association list of
scrap-type keywords and scrap-handler objects.  Initially, this
